I am a highly skilled professional with a strong passion for technology and wide range of skills in computer science and engineering. With expertise in machine learning, software development, network security, and robotics, I have demonstrated leadership abilities, interpersonal skills, and a commitment to professional growth through certifications and hands-on experience. Proficient in Core Java, Python, Android development, Microsoft Office, and recently added blockchain to my skill set, I am a well-rounded professional with experience in data analytics, database management, and the software development life cycle. Additionally, I am an enthusiastic research intern at a Centre for Advanced Studies, a Product Marketing Manager (PMM) at a social enterprise, and have excellent customer engagement, presentation, and customer service skills. Engaging in literature and language is an area of interest I pursue and I am passionate about my work - providing words for what I want to show the world about myself in a creative and impactful manner.
